They operate many sites from which their staff go out to different locations (e.g., schools and offices) in order to collect blood samples. Next, the blood is transported to centralized processing centers for testing, treatment, etc. (there is one processing center per state). Finally, the blood is transported from the testing centers to the hospitals that ultimately use the blood. The blood bank faces competition from other blood collection organizations. Only 80% of hospital demand for blood is currently being met. As a result, hospitals often have to share blood by transporting it between different hospitals, which is costly. There are no substitutes for human blood (synthetic substances or animal blood).\nTheir profitability has been slowly declining for some time and they are worried because new regulations are coming out that will require them to invest in an expensive new technology. The CEO wants to investigate potential areas to look at in order to improve profitability and wants to know how to prioritize among them.")
