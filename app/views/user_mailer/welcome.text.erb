Welcome, <%= @user_target.username %>

Casenexus.com is a platform for live case interview practice, which aims to help you prepare for your upcoming strategy consulting interviews. It offers a number of functions that you will not find anywhere else:

 - Find other people to practise case interviews with, local to you, or anywhere else in the world, in person or via Skype

 - A library of almost 100 cases carefully selected from the top business schools

 - Book case appointments across time zones, emailing a case script to your case partner so they can prepare it in advance for you, and reminding both of you a few hours beforehand

 - Capture qualitative and quantitative feedback on your performance from your peers, in a form designed by a senior BCG consultant with many years of interviewing experience

 - Collate and illustrate your feedback, to help you identify your strengths and weaknesses

The site is only open to current Oxford and Cambridge students initially. We hope it gives you a leg up on the competition.

Casenexus.com is still in Beta, and you are amongst the very first students to use it. There are still some bugs to iron out, and we would be very grateful if you would contact us immediately using the site's contact form, or at <%= link_to "info@casenexus.com", "mailto:info@casenexus.com" %>, if you encounter any problems.

Wishing you the best of luck in your interviews this year.
