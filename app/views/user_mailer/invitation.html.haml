%p Dear #{@invitation.name},

%p We'd like to invite you to join a new website, casenexus.com, that we're hoping will be the 'missing link' in the provision for management consulting candidates preparing for case interviews around the world. You are amongst the first 100 users to be asked to participate in the invite-only testing period. For you, the site is completely free.

%p The idea is simple: to help candidates to meet others to practise cases with. Developed by Cambridge University students to help them prepare for their own interviews, it's been designed from the ground-up, using the latest web technologies.

%p Features of the site include:

%ul
  %li
    A global map of users
    %ul
      %li Find other candidates who work or live immediately near you, and arrange to meet a local coffee shop to practise a case or two.
      %li Search for others around the world with things in common e.g. who are applying to the same firms in their countries, and practise cases with them via Skype.
  %li
    Case "Roulette"
    %ul
      %li Only got 45 minutes free after work to do a case? No time to schedule one with someone nearby?
      %li Use the Roulette to practise with others online at the same time as you, via Skype.
  %li
    Feedback and your performance
    %ul
      %li Your "interviewers" can, if you wish, complete a feedback form for you, with scores and comments for you to review at any time.
      %li Scoring criteria have been carefully selected by top-3-firm professional consultants with many years of interviewing experience
      %li Your scores can be viewed graphically, enabling you to track your progress over time, and identify where you need to improve most.

%p This is an exciting time for us - we hope you enjoy the site, and wish you every success in your upcoming interviews.

%p Apart from the different contact forms on the website, please do not hesitate to email us directly at #{link_to 'info@casenexus.com', 'mailto:info@casenexus.com'} if you'd like to get in touch.
