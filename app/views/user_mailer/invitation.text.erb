<%= "Dear #{@invitation.name}," %>

We hear you are preparing for strategy consulting case interviews, and would like to invite you to something a little bit different, and special.

We are students from Cambridge University, and we believe that if you are serious about achieving offers from the top firms, you should be aiming to have completed more than 50 live practice cases before walking into your first round interview.

We've designed a site that helps you find others to practise with, and collect structured feedback on your performance from them. We are excited to open it up to you today for free, as one of the founding first 100 to be invited.

With the invitation below you can invite 5 others, accessible from your profile settings.

Take a look around. There are some features that we think you might just like.

Good luck!
