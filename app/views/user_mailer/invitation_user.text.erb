<%= "Dear #{@invitation.name}," %>

<% @invitation.user.name %> tells us you are preparing for strategy consulting case interviews, and we would like to invite you to something a little bit different, and special.

We are students from Cambridge University, and we believe that if you are serious about achieving offers from the top firms, you need to aim to have completed more than 50 live practice cases before walking into your first round interview.

We've designed a website that helps you do this, and are pleased to open it up to you today free of charge, as one of the founding first 100 to be invited.

With the invitation below you can invite 5 others, accessible from your profile settings.

Take a look around. There are some features that we think you might just like.

Good luck.

Accept my invitation: <%= invitation_registration_url(code: @invitation.code) %>
