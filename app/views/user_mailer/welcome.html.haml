%p As you start to explore the site, the help dialog will pop-up automatically as you visit certain pages to explain things - do take a minute to read it so you don't miss anything. To stop it popping-up on that page in the future, uncheck the box in the bottom left.

%p Once you've had a look around, the first step is to search for other users and send them a 'Case Partner request'. Once they've accepted you, you can communicate freely to schedule practice cases in person or via Skype, and send each other feedback on cases you do.

%p Alternatively, you can use the Roulette to jump into a case with someone whenever you have the time.

%p You are the founding users. We'd be incredibly grateful if you would, as much as you can, tell us about any bugs you find. In fact we're expecting a bumpy ride to start with, and are counting on your help! We would also be very keen to hear your suggestions for how we could improve the site, no matter how big or small.

%p Apart from the different contact forms on the website, feel free to contact us directly at #{link_to 'info@casenexus.com', 'mailto:info@casenexus.com'}
