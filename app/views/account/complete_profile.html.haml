          Step 2: Plot your Location

        .font-small
          We've taken a guess at where you are... Move the marker to a more specifc location that you feel comfortable sharing with others. Other candidates nearby you will contact you to ask to practice together e.g. in a coffee shop after work

        #users_newedit_map.new.map

        = f.hidden_field :lat, id: "users_newedit_lat"
        = f.hidden_field :lng, id: "users_newedit_lng"

    .span47
      #users_new_step2.panel.darker
        #users_new_title
          Step 3: Write a Status

        .font-small
          %p Use your status field to explain to the other candidates something about your recruitment situation and preferences for case interview practice.
          .spacer5
          %p Status's must be approved by an admin before they are visible to other candidates, and must be more than 50 characters long.

          e.g. "I am a recent Cambridge graduate, reading Natural Sciences. I am applying to the top three firms in London, and expect to have interviews in the next month. I'm looking to practise in person on weekday evenings after 7pm, or on Skype any evening after 9pm."

        .row
          = f.text_area :status, id: 'users_new_status', placeholder: "Describe your current situation"

        .spacer5

          .span32.offset2
            = f.text_field :skype, placeholder: 'Skype username'
            .font-small
              %span
                NB A skype username is required if you want to use case roulette, if you don't have one, sign-up here:
              %span
                = link_to "Skype Sign-up", "https://login.skype.com/account/signup-form"
              .spacer5
              %span
                Your skype username is only visible to other candidates you have approved as 'case partners'
        .spacer15
        .row
          = f.submit "Complete Sign up", class: "btn btn-large btn-inverse", id: "users_new_button_submit"
